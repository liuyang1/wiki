= BT: BlueTooth =

== A2DP ==
== HFP:hand-free profile ==
== SCO: Synchronous Connection Oriented Link ==

vs ACL: Asynchronous Connection Oriented Link

= Codec =

== SBC ==
subband coding

== AAC ==
BT will re-encode AAC source file.

AAC source file -> PCM daata -> AAC stream

== aptX ==
- aptX Adaptive
- HD
- Low Latency
- aptX

人儿感觉的延迟极限是70ms，达到40ms，意味着人不会感觉到延迟

== LDAC ==
Sony

Up to 990Kbps, for 24bit/96KHz stream
96KHz,24bit -> 96000*24bit/per second*2ch=4608000bps=4.608Mbps

It need compress data from 4.6Mbps to 990Kbps

== LHDC ==
HiRes need encoder with JAS (LDAC/LHDC)

Low-Latency Hi-Definition Audio Codec
