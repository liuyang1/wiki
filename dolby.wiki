dialog normalization, playback gain from -30dB to 0dB

Recommended metering approach uses a power sum of the A-weighted audio level
in all channels.

Why A-weighted level?

Due to human's ear response differently with different frequencies. For
example, human is sensitive with 1KHz to 10KHz, but in-senstive under 1KHz. So
they have different weight.

=> Dolby volume-leveling
